# Nonparametric-GS-Methods-for-Recurrent-Terminal-Events
_R codes_ of the paper "Nonparametric Group Sequential Methods for Recurrent and Terminal Events from Multiple Follow-up Windows".

Two R files and one example data set are included:
* TayobMurray.gtest.function.R
 + Includes the function to calculate the mean/variance/covariance used in the Tayob and Murray group sequential test
 + Also includes the function of getting the symmetric critical boundaries once the statistics covariance and alpha spending are known
* example_codes.R
 + This file shows how to implement the functions with an example data set.
